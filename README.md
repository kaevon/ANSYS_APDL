# ANSYS_APDL
Collection of ANSYS APDL macros

Most files will run with ANSYS version v13.0 and later, although a check should be performed.

Files in this collection are intended to be simple pull requests and calculations.
Check prior to use for applicability to a given problem.

Format of each file will start with required input types and a description of what each file does.
Keep inputs or variables at the start of each file and do not introduce variables or hard-coded values mid file.

Goal is to move most of these applications into Python or other language for use independently or as an add-on to ANSYS.
Possible use with other FEA programs.
